water_simulation_data
=====================

This program prompts the user if he/she would like to plot certain distances/angles from data prodcued in a VASP simulation of only water. If you grep the coordinates from the XDATCAR file and place it into a file and you know how many timesteps you had in your simulation then you can use this program.
